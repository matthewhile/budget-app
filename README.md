# Budget App

BudgetApp is a full-stack personal budgeting web application designed to help users manage budgets and track expenses. It’s built with a React frontend, .NET Core 8 backend, and a PostgreSQL database, 
combining my interest in personal finance with the opportunity to develop a modern, scalable full-stack application.

This project was inspired by the YouTube Tutorial - https://youtu.be/yz8x71BiGXg?si=5Ryu05Qif_oBucH4 by Web Dev Simplified. 
The code files located inside the frontend are derived from the tutorial, with the addition of my own code. My initial goal is to create a functional back-end for the tutorial code using .Net Core and Postgre, 
and then expand upon the app as a whole with additional functionality and features.

This project is in active development. More features will be added as it evolves!
